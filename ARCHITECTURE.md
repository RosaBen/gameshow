## 🎮 Navigation Flow

```
Homepage → Game Detail → Results Page
    ↑         ↓              ↑
    ←---------←--------------←
```

### **Homepage**
- Browse all games with search and platform filters
- Hover cards to see genres and developers
- Click "Read More" to view full details

### **Game Detail Page**
- View complete game information
- Click tags to see related games
- Navigate back to homepage

### **Results Page**
- View games filtered by selected criteria
- Each card shows game summary
- Click elements (genres, tags, platforms) for new searches
- Navigate back to home or previous game

## 🔧 API Integration

### **Endpoints Used**
- `GET /games` - Main games listing with search/filters
- `GET /games/{id}` - Detailed game information
- `GET /platforms` - Available gaming platforms
- `GET /games?genres={id}` - Games by genre
- `GET /games?tags={id}` - Games by tag
- `GET /games?platforms={id}` - Games by platform

### **Smart Filtering**
- Platform filter resets when searching
- Search works across game titles and descriptions
- Pagination supports filtered results
- Loading states prevent duplicate requests

## 💻 Code Organization

### **api.js** - Data Layer
- All RAWG API interactions
- Error handling and data transformation
- Consistent response format

### **router.js** - Navigation
- SPA routing with history API
- URL parameter handling
- Back/forward button support

### **components.js** - UI Components
- Game card creation (homepage vs results)
- Intersection Observer for animations
- Event handling for interactive elements

### **index.js** - Application Controller
- State management
- Page rendering logic
- Component coordination

## 🎨 Styling Architecture

### **Base Styles**
- CSS variables for consistent theming
- Utility mixins for common patterns
- Responsive breakpoints

### **Component Styles**
- Each component has its own SCSS file
- Consistent naming conventions
- Hover effects and animations

### **Theme**
- Dark gradient background
- Glassmorphism effects
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Accessible color contrasts

## 🔄 State Management

```javascript
// Global state
let currentGames = [];
let currentPage = 1;
let currentPlatform = 'Default';
let currentSearchTerm = '';
let isLoading = false;
```

State is managed in the main application file and passed to components as needed.

## 📱 Responsive Design

- **Mobile First** - Optimized for small screens
- **Flexible Grid** - Cards adapt to screen size
- **Touch Friendly** - Large clickable areas
- **Performance** - Optimized images and animations

## 🎯 User Experience

### **Smooth Interactions**
- Debounced search (500ms delay)
- Loading states for async operations
- Staggered card animations
- Hover feedback on all interactive elements

### **Intuitive Navigation**
- Breadcrumb-style navigation
- Clear back buttons
- Consistent interaction patterns
- Visual feedback for clickable elements

This refactored architecture provides a maintainable, scalable foundation for the game search application with improved user experience and code organization.
